			<h1>Employed Persons with Managerial Responsibilities in OECD Countries</h1>
			<p class="subtitle">The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development or OECD collects and collates data about a wide variety of human interests. Indicators include employment data, the Better Life Index, and many others. This is a visualization of the available data regarding employment in managerial positions by sex from 2001 to 2011. It was created as the final project in my MVIS5301 - Statitical Applications for Visualization class at <a href="http://www.mcia.edu">MICA</a> while enrolled in the MPS Information Visualization program.</p>
			<p class="subtitle">One of the things that fascinated me about these data was the decrease in the total % of employed persons in managerial positions. This could be due to the retirement of people in such positions or to the hiring of persons in non-managerial positions. These data do not provide a conclusive answer, but are intended to spark interest in that question.</p>
			<p class="subtitle">It is also worthwhile to note while their have been improvements in equity between men and women in the workplace, all of the OECD countries have more men than women in managerial positions. Sweden is the closest to a 50/50 split but still has more men in these positions.</p>
